## Problem statement
This could be understood in two leves: a business problem and a technical problem. 

### _Business problem:_
Process control and decision-making dynamics within the Employment and Inclusive Development Office of the Mayor’s Office of Barranquilla have historically relied on data dispersed across multiple areas. As a result, tasks such as managing resources to serve both job-seeking citizens and employers in need of talent became a monumental challenge.

To address these issues, there is a pressing need for a solution that streamlines data processing, significantly reduces response times, and ensures the continuous availability of high-quality information.
