# Public Employment Pulse

*A Python powered data engineering initiative by the Employment and Inclusive Development Office of the Mayor’s Office of Barranquilla.*

Public Employment Pulse is a strategic data-driven project designed to provide insights into the structure and dynamics of the public employment center operations in the city of Barranquilla. It was built to empower decision-makers, this repository combines data engineering workflows with clear analytical rationale to enhance public sector efficiency and promote inclusive development.

### _What’s Inside:_

- Documentation of the public employment landscape challenges
- End-to-end data pipelines for transforming and integrating data
- Technical architecture and implementation details
- Visual dashboards for strategic monitoring

## Problem statement
This could be understood in two leves: a business problem and a technical problem. 

### _Business problem:_
Process control and decision-making dynamics within the Employment and Inclusive Development Office of the Mayor’s Office of Barranquilla have historically relied on data dispersed across multiple areas. As a result, tasks such as managing resources to serve both job-seeking citizens and employers in need of talent became a monumental challenge.

To address these issues, there is a pressing need for a solution that streamlines data processing, significantly reduces response times, and ensures the continuous availability of high-quality information. Such a system must also enhance the accuracy and timeliness of reporting—an especially critical requirement when attending to vulnerable or underserved populations.

For the manager of the city’s Public Employment Center, ensuring access to reliable, real-time insights is not only essential for operational efficiency but also a core responsibility in the delivery of inclusive and equitable services.

### _Technical problem:_

To address the fragmentation of data and improve decision-making within the Employment and Inclusive Development Office; as a data engineer, I must design and implement a centralized data integration and analytics platform.

The solution should automate the collection, cleansing, transformation, and storage of data from three key sources—citizen registration, psychological support services, and job placement records—into a unified data warehouse or lakehouse.

Next, the raw data must be processed and cleaned to ensure it is ready for use in visualization tools, enabling decision-makers to access insights at any time. All of this should be implemented within a cloud-based solution that enhances the reliability, clarity, and security of the data.
